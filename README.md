This repo is for my solutions to Advent Of Code in Rust. Each year is a package
in the workspace, and each year contains binary crates for each day. The lib/
directory contains helper functions and structs, and is included in all
packages.

This repo is a mirror of a private repo so that I can remove the inputs.
